# Suno AI Downloader

A powerful bookmarklet for downloading MP3s from Suno AI.

## üöÄ Quick Install

**Simple Working Bookmarklet:**

```
javascript:(function(){var s=[];document.querySelectorAll('audio').forEach(function(a){if(a.src&&a.src.includes('.mp3')){s.push(a.src)}});if(s.length==0){alert('No songs found! Try playing some songs first.');return}if(confirm('Found '+s.length+' songs. Download?')){s.forEach(function(u,i){setTimeout(function(){window.open(u)},i*1000)})}})();
```

## üìã Easy Console Method (Recommended)

1. Go to suno.com/me (your library)
2. Open Firefox Console (F12)
3. Copy and paste the ENTIRE contents of `paste_in_console.js` from this repo
4. An orange download button will appear if songs are found

The console script:
- Shows exactly how many songs are found
- Creates a download button
- Provides helpful tips if no songs are found

### üéØ Best Method: Advanced Scanner (Console)

For finding ALL your songs, paste this in Firefox console (F12):

```javascript
fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RhettCreighton/suno_ai_js/main/advanced_scanner.js').then(r=>r.text()).then(eval).catch(()=>alert('Load the script manually from the repo'));
```

This loads an advanced scanner with:
- Real-time song detection
- Auto-play feature to load MP3 URLs
- Download manager
- Progress tracking

### Manual Console Script

If the above doesn't work, copy the contents of `advanced_scanner.js` from this repo and paste directly in console.

### How to create the bookmark:
1. Copy the code above
2. Right-click your bookmarks toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+B to show it)
3. Select "Add Bookmark..."
4. Name: `üéµ Suno Download`
5. URL: Paste the code
6. Save

## üì• How to Use

1. Go to suno.ai or suno.com
2. Navigate to your songs/library
3. Click the `üéµ Suno Download` bookmark
4. The downloader will:
   - Scan for existing MP3s on the page
   - Auto-play up to 20 songs to capture their URLs
   - Download all found MP3s with timestamps
   - Show progress in the top-right corner

## ‚ú® Features

- **Hot Updates**: Always loads the latest version from GitHub
- **Smart Detection**: Finds MP3s using multiple methods
- **Auto-Play**: Automatically plays songs to load their MP3 URLs
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows download progress
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Won't re-download the same songs

## üîß Advanced Usage

The downloader exposes a global object for manual control:

// Run the downloader again
window.sunoDownloaderV2.run()

// Check captured URLs
window.sunoDownloaderV2.capturedURLs

// Manually scan audio elements
window.sunoDownloaderV2.scanAudioElements()
```

## üìù Notes

- Downloads go to your browser's default Downloads folder
- Works best when songs are visible on the page
- May need to scroll to load more songs
- Each download has a 1.5 second delay to prevent overwhelming the browser

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **No songs found**: Make sure you're on a page with songs (library, create page, etc.)
- **Downloads not starting**: Check your browser's download settings
- **Some songs missing**: Try manually playing them first
