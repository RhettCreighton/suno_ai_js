# Suno AI Downloader

A powerful bookmarklet for downloading MP3s from Suno AI.

## üöÄ Quick Install

**Smart Bookmarklet - Finds ALL your songs:**

```
javascript:(function(){let f=new Set(),p=0;const o=new MutationObserver(()=>{document.querySelectorAll('audio').forEach(a=>{a.src&&a.src.includes('.mp3')&&f.add(a.src)});const n=f.size;if(n>p){console.log(`Found ${n} songs`);p=n}});o.observe(document.body,{childList:!0,subtree:!0});document.querySelectorAll('audio').forEach(a=>{a.src&&a.src.includes('.mp3')&&f.add(a.src)});const s=()=>{const a=Array.from(f);if(!a.length){alert('No songs found! Try: 1) Navigate to your library 2) Scroll down to load songs 3) Play some songs');return}if(confirm(`Found ${a.length} songs. Open all in tabs?`)){a.forEach((u,i)=>{setTimeout(()=>window.open(u,'_blank'),i*1000)})}};alert(`Suno Scanner Active!\n\nCurrent songs: ${f.size}\n\n1. Scroll down to load more songs\n2. Play songs to capture URLs\n3. Click bookmark again to download`);window.sunoScan=s;if(f.size>0)s()})();
```

This bookmarklet:
- Continuously monitors for new songs as you scroll
- Shows how many songs are found
- Click the bookmark again after scrolling to download all

### üéØ Best Method: Advanced Scanner (Console)

For finding ALL your songs, paste this in Firefox console (F12):

```javascript
fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RhettCreighton/suno_ai_js/main/advanced_scanner.js').then(r=>r.text()).then(eval).catch(()=>alert('Load the script manually from the repo'));
```

This loads an advanced scanner with:
- Real-time song detection
- Auto-play feature to load MP3 URLs
- Download manager
- Progress tracking

### Manual Console Script

If the above doesn't work, copy the contents of `advanced_scanner.js` from this repo and paste directly in console.

### How to create the bookmark:
1. Copy the code above
2. Right-click your bookmarks toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+B to show it)
3. Select "Add Bookmark..."
4. Name: `üéµ Suno Download`
5. URL: Paste the code
6. Save

## üì• How to Use

1. Go to suno.ai or suno.com
2. Navigate to your songs/library
3. Click the `üéµ Suno Download` bookmark
4. The downloader will:
   - Scan for existing MP3s on the page
   - Auto-play up to 20 songs to capture their URLs
   - Download all found MP3s with timestamps
   - Show progress in the top-right corner

## ‚ú® Features

- **Hot Updates**: Always loads the latest version from GitHub

- **Progress Tracking**: Shows download progress
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Won't re-download the same songs

## üîß Advanced Usage

The downloader exposes a global object for manual control:

// Run the downloader again
window.sunoDownloaderV2.run()

// Check captured URLs
window.sunoDownloaderV2.capturedURLs

// Manually scan audio elements
window.sunoDownloaderV2.scanAudioElements()
```

## üìù Notes

- Downloads go to your browser's default Downloads folder
- Works best when songs are visible on the page
- May need to scroll to load more songs
- Each download has a 1.5 second delay to prevent overwhelming the browser

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **No songs found**: Make sure you're on a page with songs (library, create page, etc.)
- **Downloads not starting**: Check your browser's download settings
- **Some songs missing**: Try manually playing them first

## üîÑ Note About External Scripts

Due to browser security policies, loading scripts from GitHub raw URLs is blocked. The bookmarklet above contains the entire script embedded, so it works immediately without external dependencies.
